# Predicting antimicrobial resistance phenotypes across 7,000 E. coli genomes

## Context

At Arcadia, we're interested in mapping genotype-phenotype relationships at broader evolutionary scales than previously attempted. To do so, we're developing models that can capture genetic relationships—both linear and nonlinear—that may be inaccessible to conventional methods. A key part of this development is identifying and leveraging unique datasets that both capture large scales of diversity and rich phenotypic information.

In this repo, we characterize the genomic structure and perform genomic prediction using a diverse dataset of 7000 E. coli genomes we previously compiled and published. We first use exploratory population genomic analyses to verify that this dataset contains the type of high-quality genotypic information that can be leveraged for model development. We then follow this up with genomic prediction to uncover the genetic basis of three antimicrobial resistance (AMR) phenotypes. These genomic prediction analyses confirm and expand our understanding of the evolution of these AMR phenotypes and set the baseline for our future efforts, which will explore how non-linear models might be applied for similar genomic prediction goals. 

## Data
Phenotypic and Genotypic data on the 7,000 E. coli genomes has previously been [published](https://research.arcadiascience.com/pub/dataset-ecoli-amr-genotype-phenotype/release/1#working-with-a-pangenome) and is available [here](https://zenodo.org/records/12692732)
